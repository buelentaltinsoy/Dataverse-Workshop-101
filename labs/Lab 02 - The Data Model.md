# Lab 2 - The Data Model & Solutions 🏗️

*In this lab, you will establish the foundation of your application. You will create a **Solution** to package your work and define your first **Dataverse Table**. By using a custom prefix based on your name, you ensure your work is unique and follows professional ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) standards for 2026.*

This lab consists of three parts:

📦 **The Solution Container**: Organizing your components.

🆔 **Publisher & Prefix**: Branding your metadata with your name.

🌍 **Table Creation**: Building the "Country" table.

---

## 📦 Part 1: Create a New Solution

In Dataverse, you should never create tables in the "Default" solution. Instead, we use **Solutions** to act as a container for everything we build, making it portable and organized.

1. Navigate to the [Power Apps Maker Portal](https://make.powerapps.com).
2. **Check your environment:** Look at the top-right corner to ensure you are in the **Developer Environment** you created in Lab 1.
3. Click on **Solutions** in the left-hand navigation bar.
4. Click **+ New solution** at the top.
5. In the side pane, enter the following:
   * **Display name:** `<YOURNAME>_Demo` (Replace <YOURNAME> by your name, for example: BuelentAltinsoy_Demo
   * **Name:** (This will be auto-generated, but you can rename as `Workshop2026`)

---

## 🆔 Part 2: Define your Personal Publisher & Prefix

The **Publisher** identifies who created the component. The **Prefix** is a unique identifier (2-5 characters) attached to every table and column name to prevent naming conflicts in shared environments.

1. In the "New solution" pane, under **Publisher**, click the dropdown and select **+ New publisher**.
2. **Display name:** Enter your full name (e.g., `Jane Doe`).
3. **Name:** Enter your name without spaces (e.g., `JaneDoe`).
4. **Prefix:** Enter your first name or a unique shorthand in lowercase (e.g., `jane`). 
   * *Look at the preview:* It will show `jane_`. This means your table will be stored as `jane_Country` in the database.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Back in the Solution pane, select your new Publisher from the list.
7. Click **Create**.

## 🌍 Part 3: Create the "Country" Table with Copilot

Now that your container is ready, let's build the table where your data will live. In 2026, we can use **Copilot** to speed up the creation process and generate realistic sample data instantly.

1.  Click to open your new created solution from the list.
2.  Click **+ New** > **Table** > **Table**.
3.  Click on **Start with Copilot**.
4.  In the Copilot chat box, type the following prompt:
    > "Create a table for Countries. I need a primary column for the Country Name. Also, add sample data for 5 major countries including their names."
5.  **Review the AI Suggestion:**
    *   Copilot will show you a preview of the table structure.
    *   Verify that the **Display Name** is `Country`.
    *   Look at the side panel to ensure the **Schema Name** uses your custom prefix (e.g., `jane_Country`).
6.  **Generate Sample Data:**
    *   In the chat box, type: `Add 5 more rows of sample data with varied country names.`
    *   You will see the grid update with real-world examples like *Japan, Brazil, and France*.
7.  **Finalize:**
    *   Click the **Save and exit** button in the top right corner.
    *   Dataverse will now provision the table and automatically insert the rows generated by Copilot.

### 💡 Why use Copilot for Data Modeling?
| Feature    | Benefit                              
|------------|----------------------------------------
| Natural Language  | You don't need to know technical database terms to build a schema.              
| Instant Data    | 	You have immediate records to test your app's UI without manual typing.   
| Schema Mapping      | 	Copilot intelligently suggests the best data types (Text, Number, etc.) for your columns.               

## ✅ Summary & Next Steps

You have now successfully:
*   Created a **Solution** to house your work.
*   Set up a **Publisher** with your unique name as a **Prefix**.
*   Used **Copilot** to build the **Country** table and populate it with sample data.

*In the next lab, we will manually add more specific columns (Population, Description) to learn how to refine our AI-generated table!*
